# Changelog — `armature-core`

All notable changes to this crate will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this crate adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Changes at or before `0.6.0` are recorded in the workspace
[`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Behaviour — static assets:** a pre-compressed sibling (`.gz`, `.br`, …) is
  now ignored unless it can be *proven* fresh. Previously a sibling older than
  its source was served, and so was one whose freshness could not be
  established at all (the source's or the sibling's mtime being unreadable).
  Either case hands the client outdated bytes under the current `ETag` and
  `Last-Modified`, which caches then hold. When freshness is unprovable the
  server now compresses the current source on the fly, which is always correct
  and merely costs CPU. A sibling's own mtime and length also feed the `ETag`
  and the in-memory content-cache key, so rewriting only the artifact — the
  usual `gzip -k` re-run — no longer reuses the source-derived validator.
- **Behaviour — `handle_websocket`:** stream and handler errors now propagate
  through the `Result` instead of being logged and swallowed, so a caller can
  distinguish a clean client close from a protocol or handler failure. A
  received Close frame is passed to the handler for teardown and the close
  handshake is flushed before the stream is dropped, replacing the abortive TCP
  close peers previously observed (RFC 6455 §5.5.1).
- **Behaviour — `WebSocketRoom::broadcast`:** connections whose receivers have
  all been dropped are reaped instead of accumulating in the room forever.
- `From<tungstenite::Message>` maps a raw `Frame` to `Binary` rather than
  `Close`; the previous catch-all told handlers the peer was closing when it
  was not.
- `LoggerMiddleware` records `duration_ms` as a number, matching
  `RequestLoggerMiddleware`, instead of a unit-varying `Debug` string.

### Fixed

- Catch-all routes match zero remaining segments again, and a trailing slash no
  longer changes the outcome. `matchit` requires a catch-all to consume at least
  one segment and treats a trailing slash as significant, so `Router` had begun
  answering differently from `OptimizedRouter` — an invariant AGENTS.md states
  and `route_cache`'s precedence test exists to enforce. A differential test now
  drives a pattern/target matrix through both routers and compares which handler
  answered.
- Route-parameter names are interned once at registration. Every captured
  parameter on every request took a process-global mutex, and the comment
  claiming the compiled router already interned at registration was false.
- `interceptor::cache_key` folded the query in twice — once raw via the target,
  once sorted — defeating the canonicalization it documents, so `?a=1&b=2` and
  `?b=2&a=1` were separate entries. `CacheKey::from_request` could also collide
  `?a=1%26b%3D2` with `?a=1&b=2` and serve one request another's body.
- `clone_response` shares the cached body instead of copying it on every hit.
- `HeaderMap` by-name lookups no longer allocate a `HeaderId::Other` per call for
  a custom name, which had made them strictly worse than the `HashMap` they
  replaced.
- Static assets resolve against `path_only()`, so a cache-busting `?v=2` no
  longer 404s, and the serve path no longer makes blocking `canonicalize`,
  `exists` and `is_dir` syscalls on the async executor.
- `param_intern` is hard-capped. `push_param` and `from_parts` let
  request-derived names reach an interner whose own documentation forbids
  exactly that.
- `RouteConstraints::validate` rejects a non-UTF-8 parameter rather than
  skipping the constraint, and `simd_parser` reports truncated input instead of
  fabricating a `GET /`.

### Breaking — `0.7.0` → `0.8.0`

The request and response types are now backed by `Bytes` rather than owned
`String`s and `Vec<u8>`s, and the work the serve path used to do eagerly is done
on demand or not at all.

- `HttpRequest.method` is a `Method` (was `String`). Constructors take
  `impl Into<Method>`, so `HttpRequest::new("GET", …)` and
  `HttpRequest::new("GET".to_string(), …)` both still compile. `method_str()`
  gives a `&str` and `req.method == "GET"` still works. Method tokens are now
  matched case-sensitively per RFC 9110 §9.1, and routing rejects CONNECT and
  TRACE rather than mapping them onto a routable method.
- `HttpRequest.path` is a `ByteStr` (was `String`). It derefs to `str`, so most
  uses are unaffected; `path_str()` is the explicit accessor. It now holds the
  *raw target*, query string included — `path_only()` is what routing matches on.
- `HttpRequest.body` and `HttpResponse.body` are `Bytes` (were `Vec<u8>`), and
  the private `body_bytes` shadow field is gone, so the two can no longer
  disagree about which holds the body. `body_slice()` returns `&[u8]`;
  `body_bytes()`, `set_body_bytes()`, `has_bytes_body()` and `body_ref()` remain
  as forwarders. `HttpResponse::with_capacity`'s capacity argument is now
  ignored: `Bytes` is handed a finished buffer rather than grown in place.
- `HttpRequest.query_params` is removed. `query()` returns a lazily parsed
  `QueryView<'_>`, `query_param(name)` replaces the old `query(name)`,
  `query_string()` gives the raw query and `push_query_param` appends an encoded
  pair. Repeated keys are all preserved in client order rather than collapsing
  to the last. `from_parts` still accepts a `query_params` argument and ignores
  it.
- `HttpRequest.path_params` is `RouteParams = SmallVec<[(&'static str, Bytes); 4]>`.
  `param(name)` returns `Option<&str>` (was `Option<&String>`), `param_bytes`
  returns the raw span, and `push_param`/`set_params` replace map insertion.
  `RouteParamsExt` adds `get_str`/`get_bytes` for by-name lookup.
- `HeaderMap` stores `(HeaderId, Bytes)`. `get` returns `Option<&str>` and
  yields `None` for a value that is not UTF-8 — `get_bytes` returns those.
  `remove` returns `Option<Bytes>`. Custom header names are lowercased at insert,
  so `to_hash_map()`, `keys()` and `iter()` report canonical names.
- `Router::match_route` returns `Option<(BoxedHandler, RouteParams)>` and
  `RouteConstraints::validate` takes `&RouteParams`.
- `zero_cost::Method` and `zero_cost::RequestPath` wrap `Method`/`ByteStr`;
  `extractors::RawBody` wraps `Bytes`; `extractors::Method` is renamed
  `MethodExtractor` to avoid colliding with the re-exported `Method`.

### Added

- `armature-core` re-exports `Method`, `ByteStr`, `HeaderId` and `header_id` from
  the new `armature-h1` crate, plus `bytes::Bytes`, so downstream crates can name
  the body type without taking their own `bytes` dependency.
- `query` module (`QueryView`) and `param_intern` module (leak-once interning of
  route parameter names, bounded by the route table rather than by traffic).

### Performance

- Dispatch goes through one `matchit` tree per routable method instead of a
  linear scan with a per-candidate method string comparison. Registration order
  still decides precedence: patterns `matchit` rejects fall back to the scan, and
  a static route an earlier same-method route already answers is left out of the
  tree, so `matchit`'s static-over-parameter preference cannot override
  first-registered-wins.
- `Extensions` is a `SmallVec` with eight inline slots instead of a `HashMap`.
- The query string is not parsed or percent-decoded unless a handler reads it.
- The serve path no longer copies the request body out of hyper's `Bytes`, and
  header values are inserted without a `String` allocation per value.
- Serving a response-cache hit clones the stored `Bytes` instead of copying it.

### Migration

`tokio::spawn` inside handlers is unaffected by this release; the `Send`-bound
change is a later one.
- Static asset serving no longer makes blocking `std::fs` calls on the async
  request path, and stats each inode once per request rather than up to four
  times.
- Lifecycle hook dispatch no longer holds the hook-registry read lock across
  hook `await`s, which starved concurrent registration under a write-preferring
  lock, deadlocked a hook that registered another hook, and caused
  `register_on_init_sync` to silently drop hooks registered from inside one.


### Removed

- **Breaking — `0.6.0` → `0.7.0`:** removed the `tower_compat` module and the
  `tower`/`tower-service` dependencies. The module existed solely for Tower
  interop — `ArmatureService`, `HyperServiceAdapter`, `ServiceFactory` and
  `ArmatureLayerService` implemented `tower_service::Service`, `ArmatureLayer`
  implemented `tower::Layer`, and `tower_stats()`/`TowerStats` counted
  conversions — which pulled the whole `tower` façade (plus its unused `util`
  feature) into every `armature-core` build for a single trait impl. The
  `http`-crate conversion traits that lived alongside it (`IntoHttpRequest`,
  `FromHttpRequest`, `IntoHttpResponse`, `HttpResponseFromHttp`, `HeaderMapExt`,
  `ArmatureHeaderMapExt`) are removed with it; they had no consumers outside the
  module. No in-tree crate, example, or template referenced any of it.
